      "pH and electrical conductivity were highest in the mangrove plantation . organic carbon was the highest under the mudflat and Avicennia marina -dominated site . the species diversity was not related to the distance from the nearby conserved mangrove forest . this study concludes with recommendation of mixed mangrove plants to restore the degraded salines along the human settlements .\n",
      "mangroves are specially adapted plant groups that have a physiological, morpho- logical, or anatomical adaptation to survive and proliferate in saline tide washed soil and mudflats . Indonesia has the largest area under the man-grove cover scattered across the tropical islands . the ‘Sundarban mangrove wetland’ shared by Bangladesh (60%) and India (40%), is the world’s largest contiguous mangrove forest .\n",
      "mangrove and sea grass constitutes the blue carbon sink, which is larger than most of the terrestrial ecosystems . blue carbon has been recognized as a solution to the global problem of climate change . sundarban ecosystem is a repository of sediment organic carbon content, varying between 0.92 to 3.29%, resulting in an organic carbon stock of 59.14 Tg within 90 cm of the intertidal sediment .\n",

      "soil pH was measured by a multiparameter pH probe (HI-2020, Hanna Instruments, India) by making a suspension with deionized water (1:2.5, w/v) and after allowing it to settle for one hour . plant-available nitrogen (N) was estimated after digesting the samples with 0.32% KMnO 4solution followed by titration with 0.02 N H 2SO4using a distillation unit .\n",
      "the reciprocal of the dominance estimator is the ‘Diversity’ value . however, these estimators are generally biased to the most dominant species in an ecosystem . information- statistic indices are used to quantify the ‘entropy’ or ‘randomness’ in a community .\n",
      "the regression analysis was used to understand trends in temporal changes in salinity regime and biodiversity . the variance of mean (n = 3) has been evaluated by the Analysis of Variance (one-way ANOVA), followed by Duncan’s post hoc test after testing the dataset for the application of these statistics .\n",

      "inputs to the ML models are identical to those in the parametric model . we first draw 1 000 datasets by taking random samples of 30 studies from our original dataset, without replacement . cal-culate prediction errors are the magnitude of prediction .\n",
      "all models were fitted in MATLAB (2013) version 8.1.0.604 using the fitensemble package in the sta- tistics toolbox.3 results are reported in table 1 . we gradually add controls to the model and find that climatic variables are signi ficant predictors of mangrove soil carbon .\n",

      "development and planning were mainly based on qualitative and descriptive methods . there was a lack of spatially explicit information on mangrove distribution and change . the rates, causes, and consequences of mangrove changes have not been adequately documented .\n",
      "data and study area Zhanjiang National Mangrove Forests Nature Reserve was chosen as our study site in the current work . the reserve is the largest national-level natural reserve for mangrove protection in mainland China . it was approved for elevatat in 1991, and the reserve was originally established in 1991 .\n",
      "ion in rank to a national reserve by the State Council of China in 1997 . the reserve includes 28 mangrove spe- cies, 139 fish species, 130 conch species, 133 insect species and 192 bird species . 25 species have been listed in national-level conservation directories .\n",
      "the city is located at the southernmost tip of Mainland China on the leizhou peninsula . the annual average temperature is about 23/C14and the coldest monthly average temperature of 17.2/C14occurs in January .\n",
      "scenes were downloaded from the global land cover facility at the University of Maryland or the USGS EROS Data Center . a field visit was conducted from December 1 through 4, 2010 to identify land use types and mangrove disturbances in the two prototype areas .\n",
      "111 e120 112 were collected from the Guangdong Provincial Center for Forest Resources Monitoring . socio-economic data and publications related to mangrove management were also obtained from the Zhanjiang Mangrove Management and Protection Bureau .\n",
      "111 e120 113 was done by radiometrically calibrating the images using the latest published post-launch gain and offset constants to eliminate errors caused by changes in sensor performance and characteristics over time . after that, the five scenes were geometrically corrected and resampled to a pixel size of 28.5 m .\n",
      "five land use and land cover types for the study sites were determined . mangrove, intertidal zone or sandy area, water, (4) aquafarm for shrimp and crab growing and (5) non-such (cropland, buildingsand roads)\n",
      "accuracies of classi fication were assessed by local experts for natural resources management . the four-point historical land use data collected from the CAS were not used to assess the classifications because of their relative coarse resolutions (1 e0.1 million)\n",
      "pes were aggregated to focus on patterns of forest (mangrove) versus non-forest (aquafarm and non-such) and missing values (intertidal zone plus water) the missing value class was not allowed to fragment the mangroves in thecurrent analysis .\n",
      "each subject forest pixel centered within the moving window was classi fied into one of the six forest fragmentation categories described previously by applying the discriminant rules outlined by Riitters et al. (2000) . birds surveys Mangrove fragmentation conditions were linked with changes in biodiversity of the reserve using routinely collected bird popu-lation survey data .\n",
      "the number of sampling sessions was proportional to the area of mangrove, intertidal zone and aquafarm at each site . a combination of point counts and transect counts were made . the average sample time was about 120 min .\n",
      "ve were sampled during high tides when birds could not access intertidal zones . binoculars (10/C2) and spotting scopes (30 /C2and 60 / C2) were used for detecting and identifying birds .\n",
      "mangrove estimates for Gaoqiao and Yingzai were 145 ha and 53 ha in 1977, 69 ha and 42 ha in 1991, 354 ha and 157 ha in 2000, 381 ha and 242 ha in 2005, and 453 ha and 353 ha in 2010, respectively .\n",
      "in 1991, 137 ha and 1769 ha of aquafarms were mapped in Gaoquio and Yingzai . in 2000, aquaculture increased to 490 ha in gaoqiao and 2439 ha in yingzais . a large-scale sandy area over Gaoqao in 1977 was changed into water in 1991 . after 1991, there was a clear trend of mangroves expanding into water at both sites .\n",
      "ngrove fragmentation patterns characterized by the fragmentation model . the model was run at the analytical win- dow size of 3 by 3 pixels . interior and perforated components were abso- lutely predominant over the other four fragmentation conditions .\n",
      "the fragmentation maps provide more insights and implications to mangrove management and biodiversity conservation practice due to their spatially explicit information on fragmentation . mangrove dis-tribution is undoubtedly dependent upon the local tidal rhythms and varies with the changes of t-dal inundation, which means different dates will have different times for high versus low tides .\n",
      "the 2001 mangrove resource thematic inventory conducted in Guangdong province revealed that a total of 700.9 ha mangroves existed in Gaoqiao and 388.1 ha in Yingzai . however, our estimates derived from ETM imagery dated on October 30, 2000 were at 381 ha . the most probable reasons responsible for the gaps are three-fold .\n",
      "a number of mangroves, especially the stands consisting of young mangrove seedlings, were undoubtedly flooded . alongi (2008),Giri et al. (2007) and Liu e. (2008) have all noted the effects of tidal inundation on the satellite-based mangrove area estimates .\n",
      "existing studies and our current work face a challenge that is how to minimize the impacts of different tidal levels on the visibility of mangroves . the challenge also necessitates seeking substitutes, for example, the aerial photography .\n",
      "thematic survey was implemented from extensive field visits . human delineation of mangrove patches usually overestimates mangrove area due to errors of human vision obstacles (e.g. obstructed sight) and deficiency in reference objects throughout the flat intertidal zones .\n",
      "thematic field survey included newly-established mangrove seedling patches in their maps . however, the LandsatTM sensor was spectrally unable to discriminate these areas adequately due to their relative low crown closure in the dominant context of water . it is relatively rare that we have access to Fig. 4.\n",
      "approaches tend to under-estimate mangrove distribution . aerial photography can effectively adapt to the local tidal cycles . it is generally easier to work around clouds and atmospheric problems with aerial photograph acquisitions . 5.2. biodiversity and environmental implications of mangrove fragmentation .\n",
      "mangrove edges and perforations have less value where the amount of forest is low . isolation can easily occur when the mangrove landscape is highly fragmented . some ground-nesting birds will be signi ficantly affected by the distance between mangrove patches .\n",
      "existing fragmented areas, for example, the “edge ”and perforated mangroves mapped by the model, will be more easily further degraded . stra- tegies should always consider the quality of the whole mangrove landscape and especially the number of different mangrove habitats and their spatial arrangement .\n",
      "human-controlled activities, including identifying the proper sites and approaches of mangrove logging, regeneration, afforestation, and chemical spill control activities, are the typical measures that can be assessed from adequately utilizing the spatial fragmentation pattern information provided by the model .\n",
      "onal Mangrove Forest Natural Reserve is referred to as “the heaven of birds” and plays an extremely important role in biodiversity conservation . changes in bird species and population numbers may be an effective mea- sure of mangrove quantity, quality and fragmentation conditions .\n",
      "mangrove-dependent local waterfoul species went up to 200 Yuan RMB . illegal capture and selling of teal often occurred, leading to a sharp decline in the teal population . fiddler crabs prefer edge and perforated components of the mangroves to obtain more sunshine, wind and movement opportunities .\n",
      "mangrove forests have shrunk gradually, leading to a sharp decline in livable mangrovehabitats during the period 1977 to 1991 . eutrophication of the coastal water has intensi fied . this has posed a serious threat to mangrove habitats and has contrib-uted to disappearance of swans .\n",
      "l species and numbers within the reserve have increased gradually in response to gradual improvement of the mangrove fragmentation and degradation conditions observed . speci fically, Chinese pond-heron ( Ardeola bacchus) populations have increased by 10 e20%, and spot-necked dove ( Streptopelia chinensis) has increased by about 30% .\n",
      "since 2005, the number of bird species and the total numbers of birds have gradually increased and the individual populations have expanded over time . the first appearance of the world ’s endangered species, black-faced spoonbill ( Platalea minor) in April 2006 at the Gaoqiao site, is highly notable .\n",
      "the above-mentioned observations on biodiversity (mainly birds) demonstrate the signi ficance of expanding the interior component of mangroves . healthy mangrove forests provide adequate breeding and nursing grounds, food and shelter for birds . expanding the distribution, mitigating fragmentation via affor- estation, conservation and education programs are important for biodiversity conservation in Zhanjiang mangrove reserve.\n",
      "the 1977 land use maps were derived from the MSS images with a spatial resolution of 80 m and four spectral bands . we need to recognize the dif ficulties in obtaining consistent satellite data for a long-term time series investigations .\n",
      "the fragmentation model used in the analysis is based on the P ff value (connectivity) and the Pf(forest area density) the outcomes (fragmentation maps) derived from the model will be highly related to the connectivity of pixels, which is closely dependent upon the accuracy of the classi fications.\n",

      "mangrove forests are tropical trees and shrubs that grow in sheltered intertidal zones . multi-tides images were needed to remove the influence of water . however, such images are often unavailable due to rainy climates .\n",
      "a submerged mangrove forest and water pixels have the largest distance in MFI compared to other VIs . in the MFI image, 99–102% of submerged . mangrove forests were successfully extracted by the . MFI.\n",
      "mangrove forests are highly productive ecosystems with significant ecological and socio-economic importance in the world . however, over the past century, these forests have declined at an alarming rate that is more rapid than that of inland tropical forests . there is an emerging demand for conservation and restoration e orts in mangrove forest .\n",
      "mangrove forests are periodically submerged by tides, especially in regions with high tide fluctuations and lower mangrove shrubs [ 9,10]. Ideally, it is better to use images acquired during low tides; however, such data are di cult to obtain, due to uncertainties of local instantaneous tidal conditions during predetermined times that satellites pass over .\n",
      "hyperspectral image with numerous narrow and contiguous bands is reliable for studying aquatic vegetation . airborne applications are exorbitantly expensive and cover a very small spatial extent . Landsat images with moderate spatial resolution of 30–60 m have been widely used for mapping aquatic vegetation [ 20–24]\n",
      "the sensor has a 10–20 m spatial resolution and five bands in near infrared region . it provides opportunities to conduct quick, robust, and e cient monitoring of submerged mangrove forests . recent machine-learning algorithms such as random forest, neural network, and support vector machine provide promising accuracy .\n",
      "the Normalized Di erence Vegetation Index (NDVI) is the most commonly used index in global vegetation studies (e.g., [ 30,31] . the land surface water index (LSWI) and the Modified normalized di erent water index were proposed and widely used for mapping surface water .\n",
      "a new vegetation index, called the Mangrove Forest Index (MFI), is capable to map the distribution of mangroves based on a single date MSI image . we will compare MFI with other widely used VIs to validate MFI’s capabilities in detecting submerged mangrove forests from water background .\n",
      "the MSI sensor o ers 13 spectral bands, with four bands at 10 m, six bands at 20 m and three bands at a 60 m spatial resolution . the images were preprocessed with geometric and radiometric corrections at sub-pixel accuracy . atmospheric correction was performed by the tool of SEN2COR (version 2.05.05) .\n",
      "e resampled to a pixel size of 20 m20 m . the study area, Zhenzhu Harbor (21280–21420N and 108000–108200N), is located in the southwest portion of mainland China .\n",
      "the Zhenzhu Harbor is a typical area for the study of submerged mangrove forests due to a large area of pioneer mangrove trees and shrubs that would be entirely submerged during high tides . a field survey of the area was conducted during April 2017, in which 408 ground truth samples were collected .\n",
      "the location of each sampling point was measured using a global positioning system (GPS), with an error less than 1 m . a vector file of ground survey points with the attributes of location (longitude and latitude), land cover types, and photos was created with ArcGIS .\n",
      "visual interpretation was performed to classify objects as either mangrove forests or water . the eCognition Developer 9.0, an image analysis program, was used to conduct object-oriented classification . a false color composite of MSI Bands 11 (centered 1610 nm), Band 8 (centered 842 nt), and Band 4 (centered 665 nn) was generated .\n",
      "cient of 0.92 indicated excellent agreements between our mapping results and ground-truth data . the extent of the submerged mangrove was determined by subtracting the high-tide from the low-tidal mangrove forest map .\n",
      "waterbody is characterized by low reflectance in near infrared at 700 nm . emerged mangrove has a relatively high reflectance, which make them separable from each other . however, when submerged vegetation are 43–51 cm below clear water, the NDVI value was close to zero .\n",
      "spectral curves of water (WB), emerged mangrove forest (EMF) and submerged mangrove forests (SMF) are observed on the MSI image . a small reflectance peak appeared in the region of 660–900 nm, the absorption valleys appeared in bands 4 and 12 .\n",

      "band 8 was excluded because Bands 7 (centered 783 nm) and 8A covered most of its spectra . its spectral range overlaps with the water absorption region . the mathematical formulation is MFI =h (1B1)+(2B2)+(3B3)+(4B4 ]/4 (5) Biis the baseline reflectance .\n",

      "uthern part of sundarbans, India, was chosen as a typical area to validate the performance of the MFI . a local high-tidal MSI image was captured on 2016-10-17 . in mangrove swamps, a number of patches seem similar to seawater .\n",
      "the overall accuracy of this mangrove map is 96.8%, with a Kappa coe cient of 0.93 . in Dalhousie Island, the MFI value of emerged mangrove forests range from 0.11 to 0.25, 0 to 0.10 and –0.03 to 0. Figure 10 .\n",
      "mangrove forests in Baia do Arraial showed positive values in Figure 11B . the overall accuracy of this mangrove map is 91.7%, with a Kappa coe cient of 0.83 .\n",
      "the lack of full consideration of tidal conditions would cause misclassification between mangrove forests and water background . in this study, we attempt to extract all mangrove forest during local high tides . all the commonly used indices are applicable to detecting emerged mangrove trees .\n",
      "based on the theory of being above the baseline, the threshold is at the fixed value of zero . 5% of submerged mangrove forests pixels were mixed with water pixels . this is primarily because unexpected fluctuation in one NIR band could greatly a ect the value of the FAI.\n",
      "the MFI concept can be applied to other sensors that contain spectral channels of red, NIR, and SWIR . the OLI sensor has a red band ranging from 630 to 690 nm, an NIR band, and a SWIR band . however, the performance of the Sentinel-2 MSI red-edge bands will also be present on the OLCI sensor .\n",
      "4.2. Uncertainties leading to overestimation of mangrove forests using the MFI . there are abundant di erences in the spectral reflectance between submerged and emerged mangrove forests . however, any other vegetation that contains absorption signatures of chlorophyll in aquatic environment can also be detected .\n",
      "the bias of area of mangrove forests obtained by the MFI is 2% larger . spectral curves of submerged mangrove forest can be a ected by several factors, including water transparency (turbidity) and distance that mangrove canopy under the water surface .\n",
      "green vegetation could not be distinguished at a water depth of 0.5 m . with low turbidity, typical vegetation reflectance was undetectable . hey demonstrated that submerged mangrove forests with a depth of 60 cm under the water surface would not be detected .\n",
      "a new vegetation index (MFI) was developed to distinguish mangrove forests from the water background . the average reflectance value of four red-edge bands above the baseline was defined as mangrove forest index . NDVI, LSWI, MNDWI, and FAI indices significantly widen the distance of submerged mangrove trees and water .\n",
      "99% to 102% of submerged mangrove forests were successfully extracted from the MFI image . the overall accuracy of classification results obtained from the image ranged from 91.7% to 97.6% . this index brings great benefits to remote sensing communities of coastal and aquatic communities .\n",

      "LETTER OPEN ACCESS A global predictive model of carbon in mangrove soils Sunny L Jardine1and Juha V Siikamäki2 1University of Delaware, School of Marine Science and Policy, 308 Robinson Hall, Newark, DE 19716, USA 2Resources for the Future, 1616 P Street NW, Washington, DC .\n",
      "mangroves are among the most threatened and rapidly vanishing natural environments worldwide . they provide a wide range of ecosystem services and have recently become known for theirexceptional capacity to store carbon . there is growing interest in developing market mechanisms to credit mangrove conservation projects for associated CO 2emissions reductions .\n",
      "global mangrove soil carbon stock is 5.00  0.94 Pg C . the amount of carbon per hectare in the world ’s most carbon-poor mangroves (approximately 703  38 Mg C ha 1) is roughly a 2.6  0,14 times the amount . bene fits from mangrove conservation can help .\n",
      "the results can be used to project changes in mangrove soil carbon stocks based on changing climatologicalpredictors . mangroves have long been recognized for the broad range of ecosystem services they provide, including serving as primarynursery habitat for many species of fis h ,c r u s ,b i rd s,a n d marine mammals .\n",
      "a n g r o v e s contain three to four times the mass of carbon typically foundEnvironmental Research Letters Environ . content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence . many of this carbon storage, however, is at risk of being lost .\n",
      "there is growing interest in developing and implementing market-based mechanisms such as carbon off- sets, to credit mangrove conservation for associated emissions reductions . a framework similar to the REDD (reducedemissions from deforestation and degradation) programs designed to protect tropical forests .\n",
      "information on the mangrove area susceptibleto deforestation, carbon in mangrove biomass and soils, annualcarbon sequestration, the emissions pro files of mangroves converted to other uses, and the opportunity cost of protectingmangroves . a growing number of researchers have recognized the need for more and better sci- ence .\n",
      "the estimates do not capture the fine-scale variation in mangrove soil carbon concentrations . the estimates are based on soil carbon measurements compiled in the meta-analyses by Chmura et al (2003 ), Kristensen and Donato .\n",
      "ourfindings contribute to the science needed to accurately quantify the bene fits from emissions reductions achieved with mangrove conservation . combined results from our predictivemodel with information on the spatial distribution of above- ground biomass enables improved estimation of magnitude and spatial distribution . our predictive model can be helpful in assessing the impacts of climate change onmangrove carbon storage .\n",
      "total of 932 soil carbon samples collected in 28 countries by 61 independent studies . observations included in Chmura et al (2003 ) and Donato and al (2011 ) are measurements of the soil carbon bulk density . Kristensen and al recorded the per cent organic carbon of each soil sample .\n",
      "the data are available in the online supplementary materials at stacks.iop.org/ERL/9/ 104013/mmedia . for the majority of the soil carbon data (76% of the observations), source studies report precise locational data,i.e. latitude coordinates reported to the 0.1 of a degree .\n",
      "locational data were reported in the meta-analysis but could not be veri fied (e.g. unpublished data) the latitude data are used to calculate distance from the equator, which has been linked to mangrove productivity (Twilley et al 1992 ). of the 19 variables included in the Bioclim data, we use mean annual temperature,mean temperature in the coldest quarter (Bioclim 11), total annual precipitation and seasonality .\n",
      "ten biogeographic regions for man-groves developed by Spalding et al (2010 ). regional indicators control for impacts of unobserved factors on carbon concentration in mangrove soils . carbon has been linked to allochthonous riv- erine or marine material .\n",
      "mangrove soil carbon concentrations may also be more homogeneous within man-grove bioregions, which we control for with regionalindicators . 2.2. predictive models We develop two classes of statistical models to predict soilcarbon concentrations, including parametric predictive mod-els and models developed with machine learning algorithms .\n",
      "climateiis a vector containing all Bioclim variables for site iand a squared term for average annual temperature based on evidence of a nonlinear rela-tionship between mangrove soil carbon and temperature . iis an assumed mean-zero normally distributed random error .\n",
      "ML algorithms have a long history in the field of medical biosciences . they are rapidly gaining ground in several fields ranging from economics (Varian 2013 ) to conservation biology and ecology (Gomes 2009 , Dietterich 2009 ). they involvesystematic computational learning in the model-buildingprocess .\n",
      "inputs to the ML models are identical to those in the parametric model . we first draw 1 000 datasets by taking random samples of 30 studies from our original dataset, without replacement . cal-culate prediction errors are the magnitude of prediction .\n",
      "all models were fitted in MATLAB (2013) version 8.1.0.604 using the fitensemble package in the sta- tistics toolbox.3 results are reported in table 1 . we gradually add controls to the model and find that climatic variables are signi ficant predictors of mangrove soil carbon .\n",
      "uncontrolled regional means are obtained by regressing soil carbon concentrations on the full set ofregional indicator variables without any other controls . mangroves in north and central America contain some of the most carbon-rich soils .\n",
      "l 4, which controls for latitude, climatic conditions, and sample region, outperforms all other parametric predic-tions explored here in terms of attaining the highest R-squared and lowest AIC . we select it as our preferred parametric speci fication and compare it to the two ML models.\n",
      "lts indicate that both ML methods outperform our preferred parametric predictive model by achieving smaller average out-of-sample SSE and MPE . of the two methods, the bag DT performs better than the boosted DT, so we select it as our preferred ML model .\n",
      "soil carbon concentration (mg C cm3) Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4 Constant 32.139** 31.989** 67.819** (0.375) (0.614) (20.722) AV Latitude 0.013 0.379** 0.150(degrees) (0.043) (0.102) Average temperature 7.229** 12.210** (Degrees C squared) (1.696) (2.111)Average temperature squared 0.168** (0.389\n",
      "standard errors for all of our estimates are calculated from the standarddeviation of predictions from 10 000 ML models constructedfrom 10 000 random samples (bootstrap samples) . a global dataset of estimatedmangrove soil carbon concentrations (mg C cm 3) and stocks (Pg C) on a high-resolution grid (5 arc min)\n",
      "figures illustrate considerable spatial variation in mangrove soil carbon concentrations . global soils contain 5.00  0.94 Pg C and 80.5% of the pool is contained in 20 countries, which is roughly proportional to the per cent of the world ’s mangroves these countries contain .\n",
      "the highest grid cell prediction is 703  38 Mg C ha 1) is roughly 2.6  0.14 times the amount of carbon per hectare in the world 's most carbon-poor mangroves . we also find substantial within-country variation in mangrove soil carbon .\n",
      "the 20 coun- tries with highest average soil carbon concentrations contain only 1.2% of the world 's mangroves . but as a result of their relatively high soil carbon, these countries account for 1.5% of global mangrove soil carbon .\n",
      "a 1 degree C increase in tem perature during the coldest quarter leads to an increase of5.4 mg cm 3of soil C, all else constant, or a 16.8% increase relative to the mean value of mangrove soil carbon con-centrations in our sample . a parametric model isexceedingly practical for predictions .\n",
      "t offers auseful first-order approximation . to obtain the highest-quality predictive model given available data, we explored several predictive modelingtechniques and compared their performance along severaldimensions . if the secondary observations used in this analysis targeted sampling locations based oncharacteristics that are unobservable to us .\n",
